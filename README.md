### Better in the future

- **Sorting**

  Clients can pass parameters to sort sleep records.

- **Timezone Considerations**

  The application currently considers listing sleep records from the previous week according to the UTC timezone. However, to address the timezone problem, the following options are available:

  - **Prefer timezone**

    Users can set their preferred timezone in the settings.

  - **Date Range Filter**

    Clients have the option to specify a date range filter in order to retrieve sleep records. This filter allows users to define a desired time period, and it can also include the user's timezone information for accurate results.
